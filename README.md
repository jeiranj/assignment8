DS-GA 1007 Assignment 8
=======================
Suppose we have an investment instrument with the following properties:


-- You can purchase it in $1, $10, $100, and $1000 denominations. 

-- Holding time is one day.

-- 51% of the time the return is exactly 1.0 (the value doubles). 
49% of the time the return is exactly -1.0 (all value is lost).
This "investment instrument" is like an even money bet on a biased coin (that comes up "heads" 51% of the time). The odds for this game are very similar to the odds held by the casino for even money bets at roulette.

-- Suppose further that we have $1000 to invest on the first day. 

Simply type in the command line:  python ass8.py 
This will run a simulation to determine how to make that investment on the first day. i.e. Should we make a single $1000 investment, or 1000 $1 investments (or something in between)?
